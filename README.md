# Playing_around
This repo is used to store some projects I have played around with in the past.
It contains the following projects:

1. Fifa 19 tool: A Fifa 19 trading tool using a fifa webapp api, one of the first projects I've worked on. It has three different functionalities. One of them is the bronze pack method, a method for making slow but steady money in the game. The second is a team buyer, the user would have to input the desired players and price, and the program would buy them when possible. And the last one was a price checker, constantly checking the prices of a desired player.

2.
