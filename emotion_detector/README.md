# emotion_detector
This "project" contains some playing around of me with the fer and cv2 packages to make a small game in which the goal is to mimic the specified emotions on the screen.

### how to run
First install the packages from the requirements.txt file, good practice would be to put these in an virtual environment of your choice. Afterwards it is simply a question of running, from the root of this project:
```
python3 emotion_detector/emotion_detector.py
```
